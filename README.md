Contains plugin to add `webp` image file format support to `JOSM`

This is just a wrapper around the `imageio` plugin from [sejda-pdf/webp-imageio](https://github.com/sejda-pdf/webp-imageio)

Should work with:
* windows (32, 64 bit)
* linux (64 bit)
* mac (64 bit) - both x86 and apple silicon( the x86 dylib works.. surprisingly )
